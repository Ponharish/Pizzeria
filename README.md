# Pizzeria

This is a static web design project created using HTML to simulate a pizzeria's website. The project was developed between August and September 2013.

I embarked on this project at the age of 9 during my school holidays. When I found myself bored and looking for something to do, I was taught HTML for two days. Just after learning the basics of HTML, I designed this webpage.

I consider this project as a humble beginning to my interest and passion in the field of computer science. After developing this project, I was eager to learn more and expand my knowledge, which has eventually brought me to where I am today - a year 2 Computer Science student at the National University of Singapore.
